# AR.js Integration Test

This repo is a test using Ar.js to include video using customs marker.


# Usage


The marker is based on the Blast Pro Series Logo and you may find it at the following URL:

Then go on https://killy85.github.io/#/ and get the marker on your camera.

You should now see the video introducing the Blast Pro Series on your screen, where the marker is.

Et voila!
